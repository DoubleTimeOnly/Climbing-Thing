### Active Projects (Last Update < 6 Months Ago)
* ### [climbnet](https://github.com/juangallostra/climbnet)
    * climbnet is a CNN for hold detection and segmentation from 2D images.
    * quote from the climbnet readme: 
        > This project uses Facebook's [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) implmentation of [Mask R-CNN](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2/blob/master/configs/COCO-Detection/faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml) and was trained using 210 images.
* ### [Interactive Rock Climbing Game](https://github.com/HarryHamilton/Computer-Vision-Rock-Climbing)
    * Intended to be a warmup game. The program takes a target and analyzes a live video feed. When it determines a climber has reached the target, they win.
    * Example: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8810902/145719288-dd50d741-536e-4e0a-a9d6-eca7ccae54cb.mp4
    * The program uses MediaPipe pose estimation to detect the climber, and opencv for image/video manipluation.
### Inactive Projects (Last Update > 6 Months Ago)
* ### [NeuralClimb](https://github.com/scsukas8/NeuralClimb/)
    * NeuralClimb is a project for hold detection and route grouping based on color from 2D images.
    * Project also explored analyzing video, and    
    * Uses opencv's Canny edge detector and SimpleBlobDetector
    * Cool intro/exploratory document: https://github.com/scsukas8/NeuralClimb/blob/master/Current%20Progress.pdf
