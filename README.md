# Climbing-Thing
Ideas
* Climb recommender. Suggest similar climbs based on input
  * Similarity based on beta, holds, ???
  * How do we determine if two climbs are similar to each other?
* Body position / beta / keypoint detection thing
  * Determine a person's beta based on a video
  * Maybe show where and how two betas differ
  * Can probably use a pretrained keypoint detector
* Climbing hold segmentation. Given an image of a climb show which holds belong to which routes
  * Shouldn't be too bad. Most annoying part is collecting data
* Recommend beta on a route based on an image
  * Use keypoint data taken from different images to learn how routes should be climbed?
